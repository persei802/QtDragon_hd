<h1>TOOL DATABASE</h1>
<p>The tool database utility enables the user to store additional information about the tools listed in the linuxcnc tool.tbl file.
This extra information is kept in a SQLITE database. On startup, the program checks if the database exists and creates one if needed.
If the database exists, it is updated with any new information in the tool.tbl file. If the tool.tbl contains tools not in the database,
they are added. If the database contains tools not in the tool.tbl, they are deleted.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>At startup, a list of available tool icons is generated from any .png files found in the <i>tool_icons</i> folder.</li>
    <li>The <i>tool_icons</i> must be .png images. This enables them to have transparent backgrounds.</li>
    <li>The preferred icon size is 160 x 270 pixels.</li>
    <li>If ENABLE EDIT is checked, clicking on a table cell brings up a dialog box to enter new data.</li>
    <li>If a cell under the ICON header is selected, a combobox appears to select the desired icon.</li>
    <li>EXPORT TABLE creates an HTML file of TOOL table. The filename is selected via a file chooser dialog.</li>
    <li>Adding or deleting a tool in the linuxcnc tool table is reflected in the database table.</li>
    </ul>

<p>The tool database file in the config directory is called <i>tool_database.db</i>. It is advised to maintain regular backups of this
file. If it becomes lost or corrupted, all information the user has entered may be lost and will have to be re-entered in a new database.</p>
