<h1>XY CLEARANCE</h1>
<p>XY Clearance is the distance the probe will travel from the start position before moving down to probe the side of the workpiece.
This is also known as the stepoff distance.
The distance entered must be greater than the distance between the probe in the start position and the edge of the workpiece.
If the probe is obstructed by the workpiece surface during it's Z down positioning, an error will be triggered.</p>
