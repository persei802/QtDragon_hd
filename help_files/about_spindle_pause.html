<h1>SPINDLE PAUSE</h1>
<p>When a running program is paused while SPINDLE PAUSE button is enabled, the spindle will stop and move up by a distance 
determined by the SPINDLE PAUSE OFFSET value on the SETTINGS page. This allows the operator to clear chips or whatever without 
having the spindle running. A message box will pop up warning the user to wait for the AT_SPEED LED before pressing the RESUME 
button. Pressing the OK button on the message box will turn the spindle on and wait SPINDLE PAUSE DELAY before lowering 
it to the position it was at before the pause. This allows the spindle to resume it's operating speed before making 
contact with the workpiece. A countdown is displayed in the PROGRAM RUNTIME label to indicate when the program can be resumed.</p>
<p>If the LIMIT LED lights up, the Z axis didnâ€™t move the full distance due to axis travel limitations. However, it 
will still return to the proper Z level when the program is resumed.</p>
<p>The spindle pause function requires the following HAL connections:</p>

<div class="code-block">
    <pre class="hal">net spindle-pause    qtdragon.spindle_inhibit => spindle.0.inhibit</pre>
    <pre class="hal">net eoffset-clr1     qtdragon.eoffset-clear => or2_1.in0</pre>
    <pre class="hal">net eoffset          qtdragon.eoffset-value <= axis.z.eoffset</pre>
</div>

</body>
