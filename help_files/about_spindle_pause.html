<h2>SPINDLE PAUSE</h2>
<p>QtDragon can be set up to automatically raise the Z axis and stop the spindle when the program is paused.
On program RESUME, the spindle is restarted and lowered after a set time delay. The amount of lift and time 
delay are entered in fields in the SETTINGS -> SPINDLE page. To enable spindle pause, press the SPINDLE PAUSE 
button before going into AUTO mode to run a program. Once AUTO mode is enabled, this button is inactive.
</p>
<p>When a running program is paused while <button>SPINDLE PAUSE</button> button is enabled, the spindle will 
stop and move up by a distance determined by the SPINDLE PAUSE OFFSET value on the SETTINGS page. This allows 
the operator to clear chips or whatever without having the spindle running. A message box will pop up warning 
the user to wait for the AT_SPEED LED before pressing the RESUME button. Pressing the OK button on the message 
box will turn the spindle on and wait SPINDLE PAUSE DELAY seconds before lowering it to the position it was at 
before the pause. This allows the spindle to resume it's operating speed before making contact with the 
workpiece. A countdown is displayed in the PROGRAM RUNTIME label to indicate when the program can be resumed.</p>
<p>If the LIMIT LED lights up, the Z axis didnâ€™t move the full distance due to axis travel limitations. However, it 
will still return to the proper Z level when the program is resumed.</p>
<p>This optional behaviour requires additions to the INI and the QtDragon_postgui HAL file.</p>
<div class="code-block">
    <pre class="hal">[AXIS_Z]</pre>
    <pre class="hal">OFFSET_AV_RATIO = 0.2</pre>
</div>
<p>This reserves 20% of max velocity and max acceleration for the external offsets.
This will limit max velocity of the machine by 20%.</p>
<p>The spindle pause function requires the following HAL connections:</p>

<div class="code-block">
    <pre class="hal">## external offsets for spindle pause function</pre>
    <pre class="hal">net eoffset-clear   axis.z.eoffset-clear   <= compensate.clear</pre>
    <pre class="hal">net eoffset-count   axis.z.eoffset-counts  <= qtdragon.eoffset-count</pre>
    <pre class="hal">net eoffset         qtdragon.eoffset-value <= axis.z.eoffset</pre>
    <pre class="hal">setp axis.z.eoffset-scale 0.001</pre>
    <pre class="hal">setp axis.z.eoffset-enable True</pre>
</div>
