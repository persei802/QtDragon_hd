<h2>HOLE CIRCLE UTILITY</h2>
<p>This program creates a gcode file that can be loaded into linuxnc to run a hole circle operation.</p>
<p>The machine should be X and Y zeroed at the center of the desired circle.</p>
<p>The Z zero should be set to the top of the workpiece.
<p>The parameter units are set to whatever mode the machine is currently in, either metric or imperial.</p>
</p>
<h3>Validation of Inputs</h3>
<ul>
    <li>checks that there are no blank entries</li>
    <li>checks that the spindle RPM is between min and max rated speed</li>
    <li>checks that the number of holes is > 0</li>
    <li>checks that circle radius is > 0</li>
    <li>checks that first hole angle is < 360</li>
    <li>checks that safe Z travel > 0</li>
    <li>checks that hole start height is between 0 and safe Z travel height</li>
    <li>checks that drill depth is > 0</li>
    <li>checks that drill feedrate is > 0</li>
</ul>
<button>SAVE AS PROGRAM</button>
<ul>
    <li>checks for valid input fields</li>
    <li>creates a gcode program according to the drill pattern in the preview</li>
    <li>opens a dialog window to get a file to save name</li>
    <li>invalid parameters are shown with a red border and the program will not be created</li>
</ul>
<button>SEND TO LINUXCNC</button>
<ul>
    <li>checks for valid input fields</li>
    <li>creates a gcode program according to the pattern in the preview</li>
    <li>creates a temporary file and loads it to Linuxcnc</li>
    <li>invalid parameters are shown with a red border and the program will not be created</li>
    <li>the temporary file is automatically deleted when Linuxcnc exits</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever a new toolpath is created, a list of hole angles and XY coordinates is displayed in the report box. This could
be used, for example, to manually jog to a specific hole location.</p>
