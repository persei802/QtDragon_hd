<h1>ROTARY AXIS</h1>
<p>Some CAM tools provide a function to create wrapped toolpaths to enable machining on a cylinder. The wrapped axis is generally 
assigned to the A axis. However, feedrate commands in the gcode apply to linear and angular axes alike. This can make for very slow
movements of the A, or rotary, axis. To remedy this, QtDragon provides a utility in the UTILS page to convert gcodes from G94 (distance
per unit time) to G93 (inverse time mode). This allows the rotary gcode movements to travel at the same rate as linear moves.</p>
<p>In the SETTINGS page under TOUCHOFF tab is a parameter called Rotary Axis Height. This is the height from the machine table to the 
centerline of the rotary axis, assuming the rotary axis is mounted on the machine table. Normally, this would be the Z0 value. </p>
<p>As it is not convenient to touch off a tool to a cyclindrical object, tool touchoff is accomplished by touching off to the tool sensor
while placed on the machine table and setting the workpiece height to the rotary height. This sets the tool endpoint to be Z0 at the rotary
axis height.</p>
