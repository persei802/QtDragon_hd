<h2>ROTARY AXIS</h2>
<p>Some CAM tools provide a function to create wrapped toolpaths to enable machining on a cylinder. The wrapped axis is generally 
assigned to the A axis. However, feedrate commands in the gcode apply to linear and angular axes alike. This can make for very slow
movements of the A, or rotary, axis. To remedy this, QtDragon provides a utility in the UTILS page to convert gcodes from G94 (distance
per unit time) to G93 (inverse time mode). This allows the rotary gcode movements to travel at the same rate as linear moves.</p>
<p>In the SETTINGS page under TOUCHOFF tab is a parameter called Rotary Axis Height. This is the height from the machine table to the 
centerline of the rotary axis, assuming the rotary axis is mounted on the machine table. Normally, this would be the Z0 value. </p>
<p>As it is not convenient to touch off a tool to a cyclindrical object, tool touchoff is accomplished by touching off to the tool sensor
while placed on the machine table and setting the workpiece height to the rotary height. This sets the tool endpoint to be Z0 at the rotary
axis height.</p>
<p>When Linuxcnc is first started, all axes must be homed. This causes the A0 location to be wherever the rotary axis was positioned when
it was powered on. To change the A0 point, jog the rotary axis to the desired rotation and then rehome axis A. Sometimes a rotary job may
cause the the A axis to rotate in the same direction for hundreds, even thousands of times. Rewinding to A0 would be very time 
consuming and inconvenient. To address this, QtDragon has a <button>REWIND TO ZERO</button> button for the 
rotary axis. When this button is pressed, the A axis rotates to the A0 position and rehomes. </p>
