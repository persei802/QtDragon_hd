<h1>EXTRA PROBE DEPTH</h1>
<p>The Extra Depth feature is used for adding addional depth the the probing routine past the predefined probing depth, as set by the probe
tool diameter in the tool table. This is useful for avoiding chamfers, radii, rough edges or other abnormalities near the edge of the
workpiece to be probed. Caution should be exercised not to exceed the depth available between the desired probe depth and the main probe
body and the workpiece surface as this will result in a crash.</p>
