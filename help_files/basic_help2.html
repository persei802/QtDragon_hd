<h1>MAX XY DISTANCE</h1>
<p>Max XY Distance is the distance the probe will move before stopping with an error unless it is triggered by contacting an object.</p>
<p>The distance between the probe starting position and the workpiece should be less than the Max XY Distance when probing in the X and Y directions
in order to be within the travel range.</p>
