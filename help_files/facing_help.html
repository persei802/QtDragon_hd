<h2>FACING UTILITY</h2>
<p>This program creates a gcode file that can be loaded into Linuxcnc to run a rectangular facing operation.
The actual area covered will be Size_x by Size_y plus half the diameter of the tool on all 4 sides.
This means that the facing routine will not work in a pocket unless the tool diameter is taken into account.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The machine should be X and Y zeroed at the lower left corner of the workpiece</li>
    <li>The program is designed to run the selected raster pattern at a Z value of 0 in machine units</li>
    <li>The feedrate for Z travel defaults to 1/2 the feedrate entered for X and Y</li>
    <li>The parameter units are set to whatever mode the machine is currently in, either metric or imperial</li>
</ul>
<h3>Validation of Inputs</h3>
<ul>
    <li>checks that there are no blank entries</li>
    <li>checks that X and Y size fit within the machine limits</li>
    <li>checks that the spindle RPM is between the min and max ratings</li>
    <li>checks that the feedrate is less than the maximum feedrate</li>
    <li>checks that safe Z travel > 0</li>
    <li>checks that the tool diameter > 0</li>
    <li>checks that stepover is not larger than tool diameter</li>
    <li>checks that Size X and Size Y are at least 2x stepover value</li>
</ul>
<button>SAVE AS PROGRAM</button>
<ul>
    <li>checks for valid input fields</li>
    <li>creates a gcode program according to the Raster setting</li>
    <li>opens a dialog window to get a file to save to</li>
    <li>invalid parameters are shown with a red border and the program will not be created</li>
</ul>
<button>SEND TO LINUXCNC</button>
<ul>
    <li>checks for valid input fields</li>
    <li>creates a gcode program according to the Raster setting</li>
    <li>creates a temporary file and loads it to linuxcnc</li>
    <li>invalid parameters are shown with a red border and the program will not be created</li>
    <li>the temporary file is automatically deleted when Linuxcnc exits</li>
</ul>
