<h2>STYLESHEETS</h2>
<p>The appearance of the widgets in the QtDragon UI can be customized through the use of stylesheets. Upon 
initialization, QTVCP searches for stylesheets in the users HANDLER folder. If none are found, it will apply 
a default style from the /usr/share/qtvcp directory. To change the current style, press <button>F12</button> 
(while the UI has focus) and interact with QTVCP's stylesheet editor dialog. This allows a user to easily 
modify an existing stylesheet or create a completely new and customized one. Any existing stylesheet could be 
used as a starting template.</p>
<h3>Creating Custom Stylesheets</h3>
Custom style sheets can be created by manually creating and editing a .qss file or with a SASS compiler like 
qtsass. Using qtsass provides quick style changes and easier maintenance by breaking the style definitions 
into individual widget style definition files. By using variables for the style properties, the stylesheet 
can be updated by redefining the variable definitions in the top level file. 
<p>See <i>https://pypi.org/project/qtsass/</i> for more information.</p>
