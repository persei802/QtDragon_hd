<h1>Z CLEARANCE</h1>
<p>Z Clearance is the distance the probe backs off of the workpiece after making contact. It will then either continus with the slow
probe movement or come to rest at this specified distance away from the workpiece. The Z Clearance is also the clearance plane at
which the probe will traverse the workpiece during subsequent probing positioning moves. Caution should be used when setting so as to 
avoid work holding fixtures, clamps or other obstructions.</p>
