<h1>LATCH RETURN</h1>
<p>Latch Return is the distance the probe backs off from the workpiece after making contact. It will then either continue with the slow
probe movement or come to rest or return to the top of the workpiece to the probe Z0 position or Z Clearance position,
depending on the probing routine that was selected. </p>
